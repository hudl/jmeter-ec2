# Suggested AMIs
#
# OS            Type   AMI id        User       Available sizes
# Ubuntu	    64bit  ami-d05e75b8  ubuntu     t2.micro, m3.medium, c4.large, etc.
#
# IMPORTANT - t1.micro is not recommend for anything beyond developement, it works from a shared resource pool that can fluctuate, skewing test results.
#
REMOTE_HOME="/tmp"                          # This can be left as /tmp - it is a temporary working location
AMI_ID="ami-d05e75b8"                       # A suitable AMI, a recommended Ubuntu image is listed above. Debian/Ubuntu should be used to automate JRE install.
INSTANCE_TYPE="m3.medium"                   # Should match the AMI - I do not recommend usng micros for live tests but it's useful for dev work
INSTANCE_SECURITYGROUP="s-monolith-jmeter"  # The name OR id of *your* security group in *your* Amazon account. This needs to give your local machine ssh access and also access to the systems specified in the test plan.

REGION="us-east-1"			    			# Specify the region you will be working in. Required so that we can find the right ami in the right availability zone.
INSTANCE_AVAILABILITYZONE="us-east-1c"      # Should match the AMI and be available in the region above.
RUNNINGTOTAL_INTERVAL="3"                   # How often the script prints running totals to the screen (n * summariser.interval seconds)
ELASTIC_IPS=""                              # A list of static IPs that can be assigned to each ec2 host. Ignored if not set.

JMETER_VERSION="apache-jmeter-2.13"         # The version of JMeter to be used. Must be the full name used in the dir structure. Does not work for versions prior to 2.5.1.
JAVA_VERSION_32='jre-6u32-linux-i586.bin'   # Specify the JAVA binary you will be using in the case of 32Bit. Not used for Ubuntu/Debian.

#
# EC2-VPC Usage
# 
# jmeter-ec2 can configure EC2-VPC instances. You must:
#   - set SUBNET_ID to the id of the subnet that the instance will belong to
#   - set INSTANCE_SECURITYGROUP to be the id of the security group, rather than the name of the security group
#   - make sure that the AMI is compatible with EC2-VPC
#   - enable DNS Resolution in the VPC
#   - enable DNS hostnames in the VPC
# 
SUBNET_ID=""                 # The subnet that the instance will belong to.

# REMOTE_HOSTS
#
# If this is set then the script will ignore INSTANCE_COUNT passed in at the command line and read in this list of hostnames to run the test over
# instead. If it is not set then n number of hosts will be requested from Amazon.
#
# Must be a comma-separated list, like this:
# REMOTE_HOSTS="ec2-46-51-135-180.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com,ec2-176-34-204-10.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com"
# or:
# REMOTE_HOSTS="myhost.com,antherhost.com"
# or:
# REMOTE_HOSTS="blahblah.corp.synergy:2020,10.213.45.6"
# etc.

# DATABASE SETTINGS
# If specified, then the script will import the results to the mysql database given here
